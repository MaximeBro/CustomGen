# CustomGen
CustomGen is a plugin which adds a custom ores generator represented by a dispenser.
The generator can be obtained with its crafting recipe and will produce the ores in its inventory.
You can create different generators with config files - see [Config tutorial](https://www.youtube.com) - for more information.
Your generators data is saved under json files in the config directory and is restored every time you restart your server.
